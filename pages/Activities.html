Ethiopia has emerged as one of the foremost birding destinations on the African continent, boasting more than 850 known species, of which 16 are endemic to Ethiopia. Habitats supporting bird life are the Rift Valley lakes, the highland massif, forests and the lowlands. The Rift Valley is scattered with lakes that offer an enormous diversity of bird life; more than half of all Ethiopia's species have been recorded at both Awash National Park and Abijata - Shalla Lakes National Park. Lake Langano and Nechisar National Park are also excellent birding sites and commonly seen are kingfishers, storks, pelicans, flamingos and fish eagles. The highland escarpments form the most typical of Ethiopian habitats for birds and offer a number of species not found elsewhere in sub - Saharan Africa, like the Golden Eagle, Red - Billed Chough and Ruddy Shelduck; other endemics include Rouget's Rail and the Spot - breasted Lapwing. More than 50 species of birds inhabit the Simiens Mountains National Park, including the impressive Bearded Vulture, or Lammergeyer, with its 10-foot (3 meters) wingspan. Bale Mountains National Park in the highlands is another popular birdwatchers' paradise. The south of the country also affords superb birding opportunities with sought after endemics like the Prince Ruspoli's Turaco, Degodi Larks and Stresemann's Bush Crow. October to December is the best months to come and have a look on various species of birds."

            "content": "No visit to Ethiopia is complete without participating the elaborate; Ethiopia's coffee ceremony, which is an integral part of Ethiopians social and cultural life. An invitation to attend a coffee ceremony is considered a mark of friendship and respect and is an excellent example of Ethiopian hospitality. Performing the ceremony is almost obligatory in the presence of a visitor, whatever the time of day. Don't be in a hurry though this special ceremony can take a few hours, so sit back and enjoy because it is most definitely not instant. Ethiopian homage to coffee is sometimes ornate, and always beautifully ceremony. The coffee ceremony is usually conducted by one young woman, dressed in the traditional Ethiopian costume of a white dress with colored woven borders. The long-involved process starts with the ceremonial apparatus being arranged upon a bed and scattered freshly cut grass on the arranged bed floor. Then, the roasting of the coffee beans will commence by shaking them on a concave pan to tern them and roast them evenly. When the coffee beans have turned, black and shining and the aromatic oil is coaxed out of them, she brings the pan with the roasted beans to shaking it in front of each guest, to give all the pleasure of smelling the fragrant odor. Then she will go into the nether regions of the house, from where the sound of pounding comes as the beans are ground by mortar and pestle. The lady who is conducting the ceremony gently, will come back with the ground coffee and slowly stirred into the black clay coffee pot locally known as 'Jebena' in Amharic, which is round at the bottom with a straw lid. After she put the ground coffee flour into the coffee pot, she mixes with water then brings all to a boil for, which takes 10 – 15 minutes, then after she puts down from the fire and hang about sometimes, then she pours the coffee into little handless cups, adds sugar and then bring a cup of coffee first to the eldest in the room and then to the others, who have waited and watched the procedure for the past half hour. The coffee is delicious, full of bodied but not the least bitter and often accompaniments by a traditional snack food, such as dough bread, popcorn, peanuts or roasted barley. After everyone has drunk and enjoyed she collects the cups, then adds more water on the pot and brews the second round using the same ground and this continue up to the third round. The traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony is the main social event within the village and a time to discuss about the communal issues, politics, life and about who did what with whom. If one invited into a home to take part of the ceremony, mind it, is impolite to retire until you have consumed up until the third round, as the third round is considered to bestow a blessing. Transformation of the spirit is said to take place during the coffee ceremony through the completion of 'Abol', the first round, 'Tona', second round and 'Baraka', third round."

            "content": "Ethiopia with a temperate climate, grand mountain scenery and a tradition of generous hospitality, all in all the Ethiopia highlands offer suburb trekking opportunities. Horses, Mules, Camels and Donkeys are universal means of transport, so horse, mule and camel trekking has been a natural development. Trekking can be interpreted in many ways, but it is usually walking or riding a Horse, Mule or Camel, or a combination of the two. The animals can be used just for carrying a load or can be ridden part of the time, and the usual group will have pack animals for baggage and some riding animals the group can be used in turn. Trekking in Ethiopia does not involve any necessary skill, although it obviously is best if you are physically fit. The terrain is usually steep for only short period, when walking rather than riding may be necessary. Much of the time it will be walking, although this may be at an altitude as high as 4000 meters (13,120 feet). A slow pace is recommended, which is not difficult as there is so much to see and wonder at. Trips can be tailored to meet and fulfill individuals' needs or requirements, weather they need day trips around Dinsho, the headquarters of the Bale Mountains National Park or at Sankaber of the Simien Mountains National Park or ten or more days to explore the untouched stunning African land. The principal well established areas for trekking are the Simien and Bale Mountains National Parks. More recent lesser known trekking areas, some only recently reconnoitered including the community based hiking trail around Lalibela, Bale Mountains, trekking from Lake Ashenge to Meqdela and the remote southwest highlands and west of Omo valley, where strong and colorful cultures complement the appeal of scenery, floral and fauna can be spotted. Other suitable and beautiful areas include the mountain trekking through the Tigrain region to visit some ancient rock churches and desert trekking in the Afar lowlands. Treks have been organized on and off in Simien and Bale Mountains for the last three decades. In Simien one can trek through stunning attractions includes spectacular views from the northern escarpment with a chance to spot the Endemic Walia Ibex, Ethiopian Wolf and Gelada Baboon, as well climb Ethiopia's highest peak Ras Dashen at 4620 meter which is stand adjacent to the Park. In Bale, you can trek all the way through richer mosaic of high altitude plateau, heather moorlands and dense juniper forest with as easily seen population of Mountain Nyala, Menelik's Bushbuck, Ethiopian Wolf and some fabulous birds many of them endemic to Ethiopia. For keen hiker, Bale has offered Tullu Deemtu the second highest mountain of the country at an elevation of 4,477 meter (14,553 feet) and mount Batu at 4,207 meter (13,799 feet) although there are just the highest 'bumps' in already very high Sanetti plateau. The best time to explore and arrange trips varies slightly, depending on where you are going, but in general it is wise to avoid the rains. In Simien Mountains October through April is a reliable dry period and December to February is the best season to trek in Bale, while in the southwest highlands, which are more temperate than the Bale and Simien mountains, anytime between October and March is good."

            "content": "The trek from Lake Ashenge to Meqdela is an outstanding and exceptional route for the adventure seeker and trekker. It takes us upto the top of Maqdala Amba, where an embattled and embittered emperor Tewodros II retreated in 1867, as his dream of unified Ethiopia crumbled under the strain of internal and external pressure, most significantly his own growing unpopularity with his subject. Maqdala was once a stronghold of military for the former King Tewodros II. The power of the Gondarine Empire was eventually weakened by the presence of the Oromo, as well as by the doctrinal disputes that had undermined the Church. Real power passed to regional warlords in what is called the Era of the Princes, the decades of civil war that ended in 1855 when Kasa Haylu defeated his rivals and became the emperor Tewodros II and he made his capital at Maqdela. The siege at Maqdela in 1867 and was the main reason for the journey made by General Napier. He began at the Red Sea Coast traveling about 390 miles from Kumayli, across Eritrea into Ethiopia via Lake Ashenge and up to Meqdela. Negotiation between emperor Tewodros II and the British Government failed to reach an agreement. Finally, in August 1867, the cabinet granted 2 million pounds to mount an expedition, led by General Napier to rescue the British hostages held captive by emperor Tewodros II at Meqdela. Soldiers from four regiments, the Artillery, Cavalry, Engineers and Infantry took part. Over 35,000 pack animals including camels, together with 44 elephants made the difficult journey. Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia committed suicide in 1867 after being defatted by the British troops. The Historical perspective adds another dimension to the trek. Our trek begins from Lake Ashenge and covers about 150 miles, following the same route taken by General Napier. This will enable travelers to experience and enjoy the truly varied topography and landscape, unspoiled and rarely visited areas. At Meqdela, besides its beautiful scenery, one can visit the Sebastopol Canyon, the old church and Emperor Tewodros II graveyard. It is one of the best places both for trekkers and historians."
