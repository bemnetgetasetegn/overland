The word actually means 'cross' and the feast commemorates the discovery of the cross upon, which Jesus was crucified, by the Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great. The original event took place on 19 March 326 AD, but the feast is now celebrated on 27th of September. Many of the rites observed throughout the festival are said to be directly connected to the legend of Empress Helena. On the eve of Maskel, tall branches are tied together and yellow daisies, popularly called Meskel flowers, are placed at the top. During the night, these branches are gathered together in front of the compound gates and ignited. This symbolizes the actions of the Empress whom, when no one would show her the Holy Sepulcher, lit incense and prayed for help. Where the smoke drifted, she dug and found three crosses, to one of them, the True Cross, many miracles were attributed. During this time of year flowers bloom on the mountains and plains and the meadows are yellow with the brilliant Meskel daisy. Dancing, feasting, merrymaking, bonfires, and even gun salutes mark the occasion. The festival begins by planting a green tree on Meskel Eve in town squares and village marketplaces. Everyone brings a pole topped with Meskel daisies to form the towering pyramid that will soon be a beacon of flame. Torches of eucalyptus twigs called chibo are used to light the bundle of branches called Demera. In Addis Ababa celebrations start in the early afternoon, when a huge procession bearing flaming torches approaches Meskel Square from various directions. The marchers include priests in their brightly hued vestments, students, brass bands, contingents of the armed forces, and bedecked floats carrying huge lit crosses. They circle the Demera and fling their torches upon it, while singing a special Meskel song. Thousands gather at the square to join in and welcome the season of flowers and golden sunshine called Tseday. As evening darkens, the flames glow brighter. It is not until dawn that the burning pyramid consumes itself and the big tree at the centre finally falls. During the celebrations, each house is stocked with tella, the local beer, and strangers are made welcome."

Abune Gebre Mikael is one of the best and finest churches in Gheralta. The church, cruciform in design, is cut beautifully into a dome-like rock. Its ceiling, well decorated with cupolas, is supported by eight carefully hewn columns and arches. Four of its pillars are incised with crosses. This church has two wooden doors and four windows through which the sanctuary receives an abundance of light. Local tradition states that this reverent relic dates back to the 4th century A.D. The way to the sanctuary is itself memorable. The path is a steep climb and passes through a split, which requires jumping to and from rocks. The interior part of the church is abundantly decorated with marvelous paintings and murals. Irrespective of its difficult ascent, the church has a wealth of murals."

            "description": "The largest rock-hewn church in Tigray, known for its impressive architecture and ancient frescoes. Abune Yemata is one of Gheralta's rock hewn churches, it can be reached from the historic town of Hawzien, turning off at the village of Megab and keeping left on the escarpment. A 4km drive from Megab and a further 30 minutes' walk will bring you to the foot of the perpendicular rock mountains of Guh. The scenery is breathtaking and the mountains resemble pillars reaching to the sky. Megab is only 10 km from Degum or 8 km south of Hawzen. This church is carved on the cliff face of the Guh Mountains; unfortunately, there are no ropes, like at Debre Damo used to ascent. You can find only footholds and handgrips in the rock face. Just before the entrance to the church there is a narrow ledge carved in the cliff from which one can view a sheer drop of approximately 250m to 300m. Ivy Pearce, one of the first few westerners to visit the site, gives her account of a visit: \"I climbed up some pretty stiff stuff and then came face to face with a cliff face with only footholds and handgrips at irregular intervals. This climb I could not manage, as my arms were not long enough to reach the next handgrip to let my foot go to find the next foot-grip. Furthermore, the handgrips were too wide to grasp firmly with my small hands. I didn't want to take risks, so gave it up and sat on a small ledge below.\" Ruth Plant on her part described the church as \"...the most unusual church in the most unusual place, that place being majestic and awesome.\" The effort of ascending, however, is lavishly rewarded by the well-preserved paintings attributed to the 15th century. The interior of the church has four free standing and six non-free standing columns. It is 7.8m wide, 9.4m deep and 4m high. In fact, the church is not only known for its difficult ascent but also for its truly remarkable murals. It is colorfully decorated wall to wall with exciting murals of Old and New Testament stories. Nine of the twelve apostles are depicted in a round frame on the ceiling. Abune Yemata on his horseback is shown on one of the walls. Plant described the paintings as \"the most sophisticated paintings found so far in Tigrai.\" It is indeed surprising to learn that such great works of art existed for centuries in an \"unusual place\" that seems rather closer to the moon than to earth. And it stands to reason that the so-called \"enemies of the church\" failed to reach it or never knew it existed. It is interesting to witness people from all lifestyles climb the church \"like spiders\" on the annual festival which takes place on November 8 in most years."

            "description": "Debre Mariam Korkor, is described by David Buxton, author of The Rock-Hewn and other Medieval Churches of Tigrai Province, Ethiopia, as \"one of the many important shrines in Gheralta.\" It is a rock church situated on one of the high mountains of Gheralta just overlooking the village of Megab, eight km south of Hawzien. An hour's climb from the village brings you to the church. Daniel Korkor, a smaller rock church, is a minutes' walk apart. While climbing up to the church, a visitor enjoys the panoramic view of the Hawzien plain to the northeast and Imbasneity to the west. The church of Mariam Korkor faces west and it has a white washed façade of a built structure. It is one of the biggest and most complex rock-hewn churches of Tigrai. The interior of the church is 9.4m wide, 17m deep and about 6m high. There are six huge pillars, 2.4m apart from one another. The columns have bracket capitals and are cruciform in design. There are also a series of beautifully decorated arches, the arches and ceiling of the church are decorated with bas-reliefs, some of them similar to those at Abraha Atsebaha. Mariam Korkor is also rich in terms of ancient murals, the walls and columns of the church are decorated with paintings of stories from both the Old and New Testament. On one of the columns, a magnificent painting depicting Archangel Raphael can be viewed. This particular painting is reported by Gerster to be \"similar to the painting in the cathedral church of Faras.\" Another painting on the western wall is of the Virgin Mary with a circle around her abdomen. This circle, according to Ivy Pearce, indicates the development of Christ in utero. She further went on to state that such a theme was common in the 17th century Byzantine art. Plant observed variations in the styles of the paintings in the church and was led to believe that \"at least three painters have been at work.\" The church also has a wide collection of parchment manuscripts and crosses. Daniel Korkor is a smaller church with only two rooms. The ceiling of the domed anteroom is decorated with primitive paintings. The mountains of Gheralta and the Hawzien plain can be viewed along the route to Daniel Korkor."

            "description": "This stunning church, often referred to as Abune Abraham after the monk who founded it, Debre Tsion is a church entirely hewn from a living rock. It is rectangular in shape, 12.9m deep, 7.7m wide and 7.6m high. Its ceiling is supported by six cruciform pillars and its three sides are surrounded by a cloister. The back walls of the holy of holies, the domes and the wall panels are abundantly decorated with fine paintings of saints and apostles. The dome is especially adorned with patterns. \"When we did enter we were astonished at the beauty of this church and its many murals,\" reports Ivy Pearce. Because of the simplicity of the lines and colors, the paintings are estimated to be of the 15th century, although according to historians the church itself is thought to have been constructed in the 14th century. Even though it is amazing to learn that the paintings have survived to this day without receiving due care and protection, their color is now fading at an alarming rate due to water seepage. A 15th century unique circular ceremonial fan, one meter in diameter with wooden framework, makes the visit to this church special. Each of its 34 panels is finely painted with figures of the apostles. There is also a small domed room considered to have served as Abune Abraham's prayer room. Its walls are decorated with many geometrical designs and carvings in relief depicting Angels and Saints. It is indeed a manifestation of the great stone workmanship that was prevalent in the whole of Tigrai both at that time and before. According to Ruth Plant, it is \"one of the great churches of Tigrai, both from the architectural and devotional aspect.\" The annual festival takes place on the 21st of Hidar (30th of November in most years)."

            "description": "The rock-hewn church of Yohannes Maquddi is situated on a plateau, east of Debretsion. David Buxton reports, \"This church of Saint John, is the most interesting I have seen and is memorable, too, for its means of access which is a narrow clef between bulging walls of bare, glaring sandstone.\" It is an hour's walk from Debretsion. There are two entrance doors, both depicting Aksumite style of construction. The main entrance is for men while the secondary entrance, which lies to the right of the main entrance, is for women. The sanctuary is so bright because of the abundant light that comes in through the window above the main entrance. The church has a rectangular shape and its inside space measures about 13m deep and 10m wide. The height of the walls is about six meters. There are four freestanding pillars supporting the ceiling. According to Ruth Plant, the general layout of the church is different from that of the other rock churches. \"If I thought that the other churches had a reverent and holy atmosphere, this one more so,\" writes Ivy Pearce. Plant adds, \"So sacred did this church seem to be that while we were inside taking many flash pictures of the screws of murals on the walls, we were talking to one another very quietly.\" Yohannes Maequddi is best known for its ancient and well-preserved paintings. Ruth Plant referred to them as \"strangely pleasing primitive paintings.\" Ivy Pearce, in agreement with Plant, adds, \"The church of Yohannes Maequddi in the Gheralta region of Tigrai has crude and quite primitive paintings, quaint and attractive, different from any other church in Tigrai.\" They are in very good condition because of the nonporous nature of the rock upon which they are painted. Among the many subjects these old magnificent paintings depict are Adam, Eve, a serpent, Apostle John, and Madonna and Child. Dale Otto, one of the members of Pearce's pilgrimage to the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai, remarks, \"Their flatness, simplicity, boldness of line, lack of shading and richness of color are unique among the churches we visited. Even their occasional geometrically patterned borders are wide, have flat colors and lack the intricacy of similar designs in other churches and manuscripts.\""

            "description": "A visit to Gheralta should also include Inda Mariam Wukro. This relic rock-hewn church is situated near a Nebelet settlement and found 34 km from the town of Hawzien. The church of Mariam Wukro is not separated from the native rock. Its visible southern exterior does not give any indication of the quality of the interior. Instead, it could be said that the exterior almost obliterates the great ornamentation and workmanship displayed throughout the interior of the church. Regarding this aspect, Ruth Plant comments: \"In the overgrown churchyard with tall bamboo canes, the natural rock face, with two doors and two rough windows, gives no anticipation of the accurately carved interior.\" The exterior, like that of many others, has a completely alien leer indeed. In Tigrean tradition of rock church architecture, the concern is the interior and almost no effort is exerted in beautifying the exterior. In confirmation of this fact, Paul Henze writes, \"There is almost no interest in the exterior in Tigrai ... but the interiors of the larger Tigrean rock churches are superior to most of those of Lalibela in refinement of design and decoration.\" In fact, there are three doors on the southern facade of the church, two directly leading to the sanctuary and one leading to the inner circuit of the church (the kine Mahlet). The kine Mahlet, 9.2m deep, 4.4m wide and 5.2m high, are richly decorated with stone carvings and relatively recent paintings. Its wall panels and ceiling are splendidly ornamented. Finely incised large Greek crosses dominate the western and southern sides of the ceiling while its northern and central parts are adorned by geometrically perfect domes. Two superbly carved freestanding columns, whose height is 3.3m, support the ceiling and divide the narthex into two bays. The columns are connected by a double arch with an unsupported median pendant. It is a remarkable sight. A wooden door leads from the kine Mahlet to the Sanctuary. Another entrance grants access from the ambulatory (immediate church enclosure) on the northwestern side of the church to the three-bayed and three-aisled sanctuary. It is more than 9m wide and 10m deep. Its nine-meter high ceiling is supported by four colossal freestanding columns with bracket capitals. There are also ten columns in bas-relief. The huge columns, the exceptionally high ceiling, as well as the series of arches, domes and decorative crosses in relief are sources of its unmatched grace and unusual aura of sacredness. On the western side of the holy of holies, one can see a window-like opening in Aksumite style. It is very much reminiscent of the windows of Lalibela churches. In fact, in many respects, the church itself shows considerable resemblance to the churches of Lalibela and Debre Damo. David Buxton writes, \"Enda Mariam Wukro shows clear kinship with the built church at Debre Damo with some important Lalibela churches including Mariam, Amanuel, and Abba Libanos.\" Another chapel, accessible by a wooden ladder, houses the tabot of Saint George. It is, in fact, an extension of the church of Mariam. Inda Mariam Wukro is a very complex and magnificent church. According to Ruth Plant, it is \"without doubt a great example of Tigrean architecture.\" Professor Antonio Mordini was probably the first foreigner to visit this sacred edifice of worship in 1939."

This church is carved from the top of an isolated and roughly round rock hill. Despite its dimensions, it is rather easy to reach, and one of the least visited relics in the region. From the top of the hill, one can enjoy a commanding view of the mountain of Tserae and the valley of Womberta to the southeast. There are a number of graves and a few dwellings inside the churchyard. The church has a built facade, which, according to the chief priest, was built in 1967. Two entrances lead from the anteroom to the sanctuary. It is a three-aisled and three-bayed square church, 9m wide and 9m deep. It has twelve columns, four of them freestanding and cruciform in design. The bracket capitals at different heights and the domes and altars are skillfully executed. The ceiling is decorated with a variety of patterns in relief. Mikael Barka is not known for its wealth of paintings, but one can see murals depicting Saint Mikael. There are also faded murals visible on several columns. Tradition has it that the church was burnt by Queen Judith in the tenth century. According to oral tradition, the edifice is believed to have been sculpted in the 6th century under the auspices of Abune Abraham, an Ethiopian saint."

It is situated inside a mountainside cave, however noticeable due to its white washed facade. The mountain is 2678 meters above sea level. The view from the top of the green meadows below and of the running river Hidar at the foot of the hill is exhilarating. There are three wooden doors and four square wooden windows on the white washed facade of the outer church. The arched door, just beyond the entrance to the churchyard, is 2.3m high and one meter across. A looped cross and a carved Greek cross can be seen on the window shutters. The exterior of the church is 11.6m in width, 11.5m in depth and 5m in height. The church is unique in its architectural design. It is a church within a cave or, as Ivy Pearce referred to it, \"a church within a church.\" Ruth Plant, the author of the book entitled The Architecture of the Tigrai, reported that it is \"a combination of built front, rock roof and sides.\" The central door leads into the anteroom with three huge built columns, a beautiful freestanding arch and a water catchment basin. It is built in the Aksumite \"sandwich style\" of construction (a layer of wood then a layer of stone). The woodwork of the doors and window shutters is exquisitely decorated in geometrical patterns and includes swastika-like symbols. The window shutters above the central door are especially ornately carved. A lovely painting of the Madonna and Child can also be seen on one of the window shutters. The ends of the protruding part of the wood beams are round in shape and their presence adds beauty to the church. The area where the sanctuary and the Holy of Holies lie are small and dark due to daylight being almost completely excluded by the window shutters. It is 6m in width, 6.5m in depth and 7m in height and has four freestanding pillars about 2.6m tall. The series of arches of stone are tastefully executed. Except for its limited space and darkness, the church is regarded as one of the finest. Ivy Pearce described the church as \"one of the most extraordinary\" edifices of Tigrai whose \"design and workmanship is of the highest order.\" The church of Debre Selam Mikael is also known for its wealth of paintings. Many faded murals can be seen on the walls and arches of the sanctuary. The art influence, according to Pearce, is Byzantine."

The church is dedicated to Saint Mikael and lies on a flat-topped hill, 2300m above sea level. It is not visible until one reaches the top of the hill. The beautiful track from Atsbi leads to within a few meters of the foot of the hill. Swiss photographer George Gerster comments, \"I do not know of any trip in Ethiopia of greater attraction with regard to the countryside. The Amba in question offers a view of paradise.\" The church is almost a monolith and three of its walls are completely free of the cliff out of which it is carved. The exterior of the church is about 17m wide. The central entrance leads into the anteroom beyond, the beautifully decorated wooden door that leads to the sanctuary. The interior decoration of the church is impressive. \"Internally one is astonished, as at Abraha Atsebaha, by the complexities of the design and the skill displayed in achieving such a layout by the difficult and laborious process of excavation,\" comments David Buxton, the entomologist who studied the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai. Dr. Tewelde Medhin Yosef, the first to list the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai, described it \"as an artistically finished church.\" The church's ceiling, like that of Wukro Cherkos, is geometrically patterned. Stepped capitals and a large Greek cross hewn in relief on the ceiling can also be seen. The walls have many carvings and the wooden doors are beautifully decorated. Dale Otto, a member of Pearce’s pilgrimage to the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai, remarks, \"This church is magnificent inside, a masterpiece of stone hewing. Throughout this church the workmanship and symmetry are of the highest standard.\" The church of Mikael Imba is spacious, 16.6m wide and 9m deep (excluding the Holy of Holies area and the anteroom). There are nine freestanding and sixteen pillars in relief. The pillars are 3.2m tall and 2.5m apart. The ceiling is 6m high. Mikael Imba is one of the painstakingly carved and complex churches of Tigrai. Mikael Imba is also one of the wealthiest churches in terms of treasures and manuscripts. The 1.5m tall black iron cross which, according to Pearce, was made \"at a time when iron was much more precious than gold and silver,\" is one of the valuable possessions of the church. Many manuscripts (some partially damaged by accidental fire) can be seen in the treasure house of the church. Pearce, after her pilgrimage to the rock churches of Tigrai, wrote about one of the manuscripts, \"The entire manuscript was decorated page by page in its letters very like The Book of the Kells and Lindisfarne Gospels.\" No academic authority has established with certainty the exact date of construction of this splendid edifice. Tradition has it that it was built in the 4th century AD. David Buxton is of the opinion that Wukro Cherkos, Mikael Imba and Abraha Atsebaha are \"posterior to Debre Damo\" but \"before Lalibela\" (late 11th or early 12th century). The existence of Mikael Imba was first reported in 1948 by Beatrice Playne, the pioneer in the study of Ethiopian paintings. On either side of the church there are large water catchment basins, similar to those of the Debre Damo monastery. According to the priests of the church, the water remains at a constant level. The annual festival takes place on the 12th day of Hidar (21st of November in most years)."

In many aspects, the edifice shows a considerable resemblance to the Abraha Atsebaha and Mikael Imba churches; all have a cruciform plan and share Aksumite architectural qualities. The roof of the church was repaired with concrete in 1958. In addition, one can see modified cement work around the entrances to the church. The main entrance leads to the anteroom, 3.7m wide and 1.8m deep. A finely carved pillar comes into view in the anteroom, which is beautified by 15th-century murals, depicting angels and saints. The interior of the church is handsomely decorated with symmetrically patterned arches, columns and carvings. The ceiling is beautifully decorated although somewhat damaged and blackened by the fire of the 10th-century Queen Judith. There are thirteen freestanding and huge square pillars with cubical capitals supporting the 6-meter tall ceiling. There also exists a replica of the Ark of the Covenant. The existence of the church was first reported in England in 1868 by members of the Napier Expedition who visited it on their way to Maqdella. For many years, it was the only rock-hewn church known to the outside world, despite the fact that Portuguese Jesuit Father Manuel Barradas had already given an \"accurate\" account of the distribution of the rock-hewn churches of Gheralta and Hawzien."

Abraha Atsebaha church is also decorated with splendid post-17th-century murals and paintings depicting Biblical scenes and saints. It also has several valuable treasures; the most important being the prayer cross which, according to church officials, belonged to Frumentius, the first Bishop of Ethiopia, whose ecclesiastical name was Abba Salama (Father of Peace). The church is dedicated to the famous twin Aksumite kings who introduced Christianity to Ethiopia in the 4th century. The bodies of Abraha and Atsbeha are believed to have been put to rest in the church. According to some archaeologists, the church is believed to have been built not earlier than the 10th century. Traditional thoughts, however, date it back to the 4th century. This great wonder is one of the highly revered churches of Ethiopia.

A ten-minute drive across the plain fields will bring you to this antiquity. The church lies on the cliff side of the escarpment, 2740m above sea level. It is visible from the main road because of its white-washed facade. The ascent of the cliff face is considered difficult and even terrifying. There are only finger holds and foot grips for use in the ascent. People who suffer from vertigo are advised not to try. After a visit to the church in January 1994, Caroline Swinburn of the BBC reported in one of their radio programs, \"This is not the relaxing country hike I have been led to expect. But rather the kind of expedition for which most westerners would normally take ropes and crampons and maybe even a full-scale mountain rescue team.\" The church is partly built (of wood, stone and mortar) and partly the cave. The Holy of Holies lies in the natural cave to the east of the small sanctuary. The sanctuary is square in shape, about 2m wide and 2m deep. There are two wooden pillars supporting the ceiling. Its murals are of great quality and pleasing artistry. On the walls and on the chamber antecedent to the Holy of Holies are a number of striking paintings depicting the Madonna and Child, Angels, the Nine Saints, Christ resurrecting, Adam and Eve, and many other subjects. The names of the Saints and Angels are shown on the murals. Saint Peter, Saint George, Abune Kiros, Abune Samuel, and others are shown in their finest robes and turbans. Paul Henze described the paintings as \"...among the most interesting early paintings I saw anywhere in Ethiopia.\" He went on to write that they \"...have an originality and liveliness often missing in Ethiopian paintings of this early period.\" Unfortunately, the wooden ceiling, mortar, and wood walls of the church that hold these magnificent murals and paintings are falling apart. The openings created as a result of the falling mortar have allowed dust and rainwater to wash away some of the paint. The church is no longer in use, apparently because of the difficulty in climbing the cliff. However, Halefom Retta, a peasant farmer in a neighboring village, has single-handedly hewn a replacement monolithic rock church right at the foot of the escarpment. The Petros and Paulos church is 10m wide, 9m deep, and about 3m from the floor to the ceiling. It has four freestanding pillars. The front part of the church is a constructed structure. The church is built in such a way that it could house three replicas of the Ark of the Covenant. Construction of the new Petros and Paulos began in 1982 and was completed twelve years later."

Paul Henze in his book Ethiopian Journeys writes, \"The doors and windows with their classic heavy wooden frames ornately decorated in Aksumite style were the most pleasing features of this church.\" The front part of the exterior is supported by four freestanding rectangular columns at intervals of about four meters. The intervals are filled with masonry. The roof of the church blends in with the hill out of which the church is carved. It was reported by Ivy Pearce, who visited the rock churches of Tigrai in the 1960s, that they resemble \"the thatched roofs of 15th-century English homes.\" At the top of the whitewashed exterior, there are three square windows decorated with Saint Andrew's crosses. Unlike its neighboring rock churches, Medhane Alem Adi Kesho has a cloister that runs from the north to the south end of the church and is beautifully decorated with patterns. Two doors lead to the sanctuary, where there are six huge square pillars supporting the ceiling, 10.20m wide and 10.35m deep. One can see a striking cross on the right side of the sanctuary's back wall, and its ceiling is delightfully and skillfully decorated with bas-relief and symmetrical patterns. Dale Otto reports, \"Because of the size and massive freestanding pillars, the church is decidedly Cathedral-like in its feeling, very majestic.\" There are no paintings whatsoever, but their absence is surely a blessing in disguise in the sense that their presence would have concealed the wonderfully hewn walls. According to Ruth Plant, Medhane Alem Adi Kesho is \"one of the truly great churches of the Tigrai.\" No academic authority has suggested a definite date of construction for the church. However, David Buxton, who regards the church as \"the earliest known attempt to copy a Debre-Damo type church in solid rock,\" hinted that the feasible period for the construction of the church is the late 10th or early 11th century, before Lalibela. Certainly, this edifice is one of the best rock-hewn churches of Tigrai in terms of architectural quality. It is a remarkable legacy in which we can see how advanced rock architecture was in Tigrai."

"description": "The Abyssinian Catbird is one of the finest, if not the finest singer of all the birds of Africa, is frequent too common in the western and southern highlands between 1800 and 3500 meters (600 - 11,500 feet) in giant heath, Saint John's wort, highland bamboo, juniper, Podocarpus and olive forests. It lives singly, in pairs or in parties up to eight often in thickets and vines that fringe these forests. It is found as far north as the Simien Mountains. The catbird is a resident garden bird of plateau cities; for example, it is a regular inhabitant in Addis Ababa in gardens with large trees, for instance around embassies, hotels and many private compounds.\n\nOne usually first notices the catbird when it sings. The birds, which appear to be territorial, are intense singers in the rains when a male and a female often duet persistently. The male, stretching his neck skyward and holding his wings out at the bend, vigorously produces a long clear ringing song: the female answers with a char or purring note. Because the little-known catbird lives in dense parts of thickets, it is sometimes difficult to see. Distinguishing features are its general grayish color, dirty white forehead and chestnut belly and under tail coverts. This endemic is known to feed on juniper berries, but other items in its diet are not known. It certainly nests in May and July; it probably nests from February through July. The nest is a small, frail, thin, cup like structure of plant stems placed loosely in a tangle of vines; one was discovered five meters up in a Saint John's wort tree. The eggs, two in number, are pale flesh colored and uniformly covered with fine flesh marks and a few dark chestnut spots. The classification of the catbird is not well understood: it may be a flycatcher or a babbler. Recent evidence, based on plumage characters, indicates that the Abyssinian Catbird is a babbler whose nearest relative may be the Bush Blackcap, also called Blackcap Babbler (Lioptilus Nigricapillus), found in the thickets and forests of eastern South Africa."

They are common grassland birds of the western and southeastern highlands except in the extreme north where it does not occur. Like other long claws, this Ethiopian endemic inhabits grasslands and has plumage markings similar to those of meadowlarks of North and South America (passerine birds that are not related to long claws).\n\nThe Abyssinian Long Claw occurs largely between 1,200 and 3,050 meters (4,000 - 10,000 feet) but occasionally reaches the grassland and moorlands up to 4,100 meters (13,500 feet); it is most common between 1,800 and 2,750 meters (6,000–9,000 feet). Living singly or in pairs, this Long Claw is usually seen sitting on a lump of dirt, a rock, a small bush or a fence. Its black necklace and saffron throat and neck are especially obvious when it sits. Considered to be \"tame and friendly\", when breeding, it nests in February, June, July and August. Its nest is a cup-like structure raised slightly above the ground and lined with various grass fibers. The eggs, two or three in number, are glossy, pale greenish-white and flecked with dull brown. It makes a clear trilling little song from a perch or on the wing and a piping call note."

The barbet has also been described to hawk insects like a flycatcher and to hang from a branch upside down like a tit. Its call notes are metallic, and it produces a \"gr-gr-grgrgr...\" in rising tempo.

"description": "The distribution, numbers, time of nesting and life history of the Black Headed Forest Oriole are not clearly understood because of the difficulty of distinguishing it from the Black Headed Oriole (Oriolus larvatus). The two are separable by the color of parts of wing feathers, features that are not easy to see in the field. The outer margins of the flight feathers (primaries) and the outer secondaries of the Forest Oriole are grey; the inner secondaries, mainly olivaceous-yellow, are edged in grey on the inner webs. The outer margins of the primaries and outer secondaries of the Black Headed Oriole are white; the inner secondaries, mainly black, are edged in pale yellow on the outer webs.\n\nIn the field the two species are partially separable by habitat, the haunts of each differing somewhat. The Black Headed Forest Oriole inhabits evergreen forest (olive, Podocarpus) and juniper woods of the highlands; it is absent in lowland dry acacia thorn scrub country. The Black Headed Oriole, on the other hand, lives in the lowland dry acacia thorn scrub country and the juniper woods of the highlands; it does not inhabit the highland evergreen forest.\n\nThe Black Headed Forest Oriole occurs in the western and southeastern highlands, the Rift Valley and southern Ethiopia from about 1,200–3,200 meters (4,000–10,500 feet). It is frequent in the north, common to abundant in the south. It breeds in August and possibly July. It has three calls: a rich and loud \"li\", a harsh \"skaa-skaa\", and three or four liquid whistling notes slurred together.

"description": "The Blue Winged Goose inhabits plateau marshes, streams and damp grasslands from about 1,800 meters (6,000 feet) upward. Pairs or small parties of three to five of these geese are common and easily seen at high elevations in small stream valleys and in pools and marshes in the moorlands where giant lobelia, Alchemilla and tussock grass predominate. They nest in March, April, June and September. During the big rains of July, August and September, Blue Winged Geese flock in groups that may include 50 to 100 or more individuals which at this time probably undergo molt, losing the flight feathers. In the big rains the flocks also move to lower elevations of the plateau; for example, in one day in August 165 individuals were counted at Gefersa Reservoir, some 20 kilometers west of Addis Ababa.\n\nThe goose has a peculiar habit, whether standing or walking, of resting its neck on its back. This posture, together with the comparatively dull body color and bluish wing patches, are useful marks for identifying the species. Another characteristic habit can be observed during pair formation when the male struts around the female, his head bent over his back, bill pointed skywards or even behind him, exposing his blue wing patch and uttering a rapidly repeated, soft, barely audible whistle: \"wnee–whu–whu–whu–whu–whu–whu.\" Parties of this goose, like other geese, station sentinels at the periphery of the flock. An alarmed goose produces a soft \"whew–whu–whu–wliu,\" and when forced into flight, a rather nasal bark, \"penk-penk-penk,\" uttered at takeoff but not in flight.\n\nStudies of captive Blue Winged Geese suggest that they are largely active at night, which may explain why so little is known about the species. This goose lays four to seven cream-colored eggs. The nestling is largely black with various silvery-white markings above and silvery-white below. The immature is similar to but duller than the adult. In total numbers, the Blue Winged Goose seems to be one of the least numerous of any species of goose in the world."

It inhabits forests and woodlands with Hagenia, juniper, Podocarpus, olive, acacia, candelabra euphorbia, combretum, and fig, and commonly visits gardens with seeding trees in Addis Ababa. The lovebird flies in noisy flocks of usually 5–10 individuals, though flocks of 50–80 may occur. It flies swiftly with sharp turns and quick, short wing flaps, revealing the black underwing. Both sexes have a bright red bill; males have a red forehead, while females and immatures do not. \n\nIn captivity, the lovebird is sociable: pairs stand close, sometimes bouncing heads and necks and moving in circles before pressing together. It walks rather than hops. In the wild, it feeds on juniper berries, figs, and seeds, and sleeps in tree holes at night. It has a shrill twittering call and a sharp whistle in flight. Only one nest record exists from around 1900; the species appears to be a solitary nester, likely from March through November."

First recorded in 1898 at Ahiyafej, then in 1927 at Bichana, and 1930 at Kalo Ford, few other records exist, though recent reports suggest it may be more widely distributed.\n\nThe male has a distinctive U-shaped pattern on black and white breast feathers; the female is unknown. Its habitat preferences, nest, eggs, breeding season, diet, call, and behaviors are all unrecorded. Locals in the 1920s-30s were familiar with it, indicating it may have been more common. It is likely that Harwood's Francolin inhabits dense bush along stream beds and rocky hills with long grass or brush, similar to its close relatives, Hildebrandt's Francolin (Francolinus hildebrandt) and Natal Francolin (F. natalensis) of Central and Southern Africa."

First collected by Prince Ruspoli in 1892 or 1893, the exact locality and date of the first specimen are unknown due to the explorer's untimely death. T. Salvadori studied the collection in 1896 and named the species in honor of Prince Ruspoli. Several attempts to locate the bird after that were unsuccessful until the early 1940s, when specimens were obtained in the Arero forest. More recently, the species has been observed and collected north of Negele.\n\nPrince Ruspoli's Turaco is considered endangered and listed in the 'Red Book' of endangered animals, though recent sightings suggest it may be more common than thought. It inhabits juniper forests and dry water courses with figs, rubiaceous trees, Adina, and undergrowth of acacia and teclea shrubs. Breeding behavior, nest, and eggs are unknown.

It has two calls useful for identification: a piercing alarm note, 'dideet' or 'a di-dii', and a display call, 'wreeeee – creeuw – wreeeee - creeliw'. This rail inhabits high elevations up to 4,100 meters (13,500 feet), favoring small pockets of grass tussock and wet hollows with plenty of cover, characteristic of Ethiopian moorlands.\n\nLike other rails, Rouget's Rail skulks through grass tussocks, likely feeding on aquatic insects, crustaceans, small snails, and seeds. Slightly larger than many related rails, it is relatively tame and sometimes visible in open areas, though usually only fleetingly. Both sexes have similar russet plumage, while juveniles are slightly lighter. It sometimes occurs in family parties of three to ten and is less nocturnal than previously thought. Nesting occurs from April through October, with a shallow cup of grass placed in tussock grass. Clutches may contain up to eight eggs, brownish cream with reddish-brown splashes and lilac-grey under markings. Nestlings are yellow-brown with black along the sides of the face, russet neck, and black crown, bill, and legs."

Widely distributed and locally common, it is usually seen in pairs or small parties, and during the non-breeding season, in flocks of up to 30 - 40 individuals.\n\nThe bird is relatively tame and noisy, with a swerving flight. On the ground, it makes short runs and sudden stops. Its calls include 'kree – kree – kre – krep – kreep - kreep', 'kueeeep - kueep', and 'pewit - pewit'. It is distinguished by fleshy wattles in front of the eyes and a breast spotted with black.\n\nNesting has only recently been documented: a shallow scrape within grass and moss in the giant lobelia moorlands, often near small lakes, contained four eggs, brownish blue to smoke grey, heavily marked with black. The plover breeds in April in the Bale Mountains and in August in the Shoa Region. Other aspects of its life history remain largely unrecorded."

Its north-south distribution is limited by elevation and habitat: higher and mountainous to the north, lower and more open to the south. Surrounding areas of similar elevation, such as parkland acacia country, do not host the species. The Bush Crow resembles a Starling, including in nest structure, and often associates with White Crowned Starlings (Spreo albicapillus), though it belongs to the Crow family, likely related to Choughs (Pyrrhocorax sp.). The bird travels in parties of about six from June to February.\n\nThe nest is built in February and March, 5–6 meters above ground atop an acacia. It is globular, made of thorn twigs 30+ cm long, about 60 cm in diameter, with an inner chamber 30 cm across lined with dung and dry grass. The entrance is from the top via a vertical tubular tunnel 15 cm long. The Bush Crow is not colonial, though three individuals have been seen at one nest.

  "description": "Settled agriculture began in Ethiopia some 2,000 years ago. Since time immemorial, coffee Arabica has been grown in the wild forests of the southwestern massive highlands of the Kaffa and Buno district of the country. Ethiopia is the primary centre of origin and genetic diversity of the Arabica coffee plant, earlier known as jasminum arabicum laurifolia.\n\nThe story of coffee has its beginnings in Ethiopia, the original home of the coffee plant; coffee Arabica, which still grows wild in the forest of the highlands. While nobody is sure exactly how coffee was originally discovered as a beverage, it is believed that its cultivation and use began as early as the 9th century. Some authorities claim that it was cultivated in the Yemen earlier, around AD 575. The only thing that seems certain is that it originated in Ethiopia, from where it traveled to Yemen about 600 years ago, and from Arabia it began its journey around the world.\n\nAmong the many legends that have developed concerning the origin of coffee, one of the most popular accounts is that of Kaldi, an Abyssinian goatherd, who lived around AD 850. One day he observed his goats behaving in abnormally exuberant manner, skipping, rearing on their hind legs and bleating loudly. He noticed they were eating the bright red berries that grew on the green bushes nearby.\n\nKaldi tried a few himself, and soon felt a novel sense of elation. He filled his pockets with the berries and ran home to announce his discovery to his wife. ‘They are heaven sent,’ she declared. ‘You must take them to the Monks in the monastery.’ Kaldi presented the chief Monk with a handful of berries and related his discovery of their miraculous effect. “Devil’s work!’’ exclaimed the monk, and hurled the berries in the fire. Within minutes the monastery filled with the heavenly aroma of roasting beans, and the other monks gathered to investigate. The beans were raked from the fire and crushed to extinguish the embers. The Monk ordered the grains to be placed in the ewer and covered with hot water to preserve their goodness. That night the monks sat up drinking the rich and fragrant brew, and from that day vowed they would drink it daily to keep them awake during their long, nocturnal devotions.\n\nWhile the legends attempt to condense the discovery of coffee and its development as a beverage into one story, it is believed that the monks of Ethiopia may have chewed on the berries as a stimulant for centuries before it was brewed as a hot drink.\n\nAnother account suggests that coffee was brought to Arabia from Ethiopia, by Sudanese slaves who chewed the berries en route to help them survive the journey. There is some evidence that coffee was ground and mixed with butter, and consumed like chocolate for sustenance, a method reportedly used by the Oromo tribe of Ethiopia, which lends some credence to the story of the Sudanese slaves. The practice of mixing ground coffee beans with ghee (clarified butter) persists to this day in some parts of Kaffa and Sidamo; two of the principle coffee producing regions of Ethiopia, and in Kaffa, from which its name derives, the drink is brewed today with the addition of melted ghee which gives it a distinctive, buttery flavor.\n\nToday Ethiopia is Africa’s major exporter of Arabica beans, the quality coffee of the world, and the variety that originated in Ethiopia, is still the only variety grown there. Coffee Arabica, which was identified by the botanist Linnaeus in 1753, is one of the two major species used in most production, and presently accounts around 70 percent of the world’s coffee.\n\nThe other major species is Coffea Canefora, or Robusta, whose production is increasing now due to better yields from Robusta trees and their hardiness against decease. Robusta coffea is mostly used in blend, but Arabica is the only coffee to be drunk on its own unblended, and this is the type grown and drunk in Ethiopia, the Arabica and Robusta trees both produce crops within 3 - 4 years after planting, and remain productive for 20 - 30 years. Arabica trees flourish ideally in a seasonal climate with a temperature range of 59 - 750 F, whereas Robusta prefers an equatorial climate.\n\nIn Ethiopia’s province of Kaffa a large proportion of the Arabica trees grow wild amidst the rolling hills and forests of the fertile and beautiful region. At an altitude of 1,500 meters the climate is ideal and the plants are well protected by the larger forest trees which provide shade from the midday sun and preserve the moisture in the soil. Traditionally, these are the ideal conditions for coffee growing. There are two methods of processing coffee: the wet and the dry. Commercially the wet method is preferred, but the small producer who picks the cherries wild may save time by sun drying the beans after picking, and they sell them direct to customers in the local market.\n\nSome 12 million people are dependent on Ethiopia’s coffee industry, managed by the Ethiopian Coffee Export Enterprise formerly know as the Ethiopian Coffee Marketing Corporation. An independent, profit making organization, trades on the open market and controls about 50 percent of the market following liberalization.\n\nCoffee from Sidamo in the south has an unusual flavor and is very popular, especially the beans from the place known as Yirgacheffes. In many ways Ethiopian coffee is unique, having neither excessive pungency nor the acidity of the Kenyan brands. It is closest in character to the Mocha coffee of the Yemen, with which it supposedly shares a common origin, and it cannot be high roasted or its character is destroyed. The best Ethiopian coffee may be compared with the finest coffee in the world, and premium washed Arabica beans fetch high prices on the world market.\n\nNo visit to Ethiopia is complete without participating in the elaborate coffee ceremony that is Ethiopia's traditional form of hospitality. Invariably conducted by a beautiful young girl in traditional Ethiopian costume, the ceremonial apparatus is arranged upon a bed of long grasses. The green beans are roasted in a pan over a charcoal brazier, the rich aroma of coffee mingling with the heady smell of incense that is always burned during the ceremony. The beans are then pounded with a pestle and mortar, and the ground coffee then brewed in a black pot with a narrow spout. Traditional accompaniments are popcorn also roasted on the fire, and the coffee is sugared to be drunk from small handless cups."
